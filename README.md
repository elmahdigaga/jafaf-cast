# JafafCast

JafafCast is a web application designed to predict droughts in Morocco using Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and Cybersecurity technologies. This project aims to address the critical challenge of drought prediction in Morocco by providing accurate forecasts and insights to farmers, policymakers, and the general public.

## Purpose

Morocco faces recurrent droughts that have significant impacts on agriculture, water resources, and livelihoods. Traditional methods of drought prediction often lack accuracy and timeliness, leading to challenges in mitigation and adaptation. JafafCast aims to revolutionize drought prediction in Morocco by leveraging cutting-edge technologies to provide precise forecasts and actionable insights.

## Problem Statement

Morocco's agricultural sector heavily relies on predictable weather patterns. However, recurrent droughts disrupt these patterns, leading to decreased crop yields, water shortages, and economic losses. Traditional methods of drought prediction are often inadequate in the face of increasingly complex weather patterns associated with climate change. JafafCast addresses these challenges by using advanced machine learning algorithms and blockchain technology to provide accurate and timely drought predictions.

## Features

- **AI-based Drought Prediction**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict drought likelihood in Moroccan regions.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Secures and stores climate data on the Ethereum blockchain for transparency and integrity.
- **Interactive Platform**: Allows users to engage with daily articles and discussions related to drought predictions.
- **User Authentication**: Implements stateless authentication with JWT tokens for enhanced security.
